  <p>
    Carlos works at <a href="https://totvs.com.br">TOTVS S/A</a>.
    When he's not doing that, he's
    <a href="http://nerde.github.com">blogging</a>, hacking on
    <a href="https://github.com/nerde">open source</a>, and learning new
    things. He has proficiency in Java and Ruby (preffer ruby, of course), but
    also knew something about python, haskell and erlang. He is married with
    this beutiful girl in the photo and lives with her in Joinville
    (Santa Catarina - Brazil).

  <p>
    Carlos used to have a pretty, bad-ass and eye-candy bloated curriculum here,
    but, well, there is so much places to update. So, check his
    <a href="http://br.linkedin.com/in/">LinkedIn</a> Profile.
